- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pere000

Although the porpouse of Mr. Tim de Pater is to keep his original trafex/php-nginx 'as simple as possible', I have added 'Bash GNU Shell' to his original hub.docker.com/r/trafex/php-nginx:

	Maintainer="Tim de Pater <code@trafex.nl>"
	Description="Lightweight container with Nginx 1.20 & PHP 8.0 based on Alpine Linux." ... implemented with the addition of 'Bash GNU Shell' (28.Jun.2022)

By adding about 6 Mb for Bash, you get convenience in development to code web applications that use advanced bash scriptsâ€”instead of Python, Perl, etc.â€”to implement PHP tasks even in production. My web applications are limited to localhost domains for security reasons and, due to sociological interests, I like everyone to work with Bash GNU Shell. But this 'traffex/php-nginx' fork in expert hands should not present additional security risks on the Internet network.

You can read about how this modest fork was made, and take some basic precautions when running it in your web application, at [https://github.com/pere000/pere000/blob/main/Over%20a%20Webb%20App](https://github.com/pere000/pere000/blob/main/OverWebApp.txt)
