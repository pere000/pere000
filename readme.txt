Fork based on the original work from "Tim de Pater <code@trafex.nl>" at https://hub.docker.com/r/trafex/php-nginx.

Although the porpouse of Mr. Tim de Pater is to keep his original trafex/php-nginx 'as simple as possible', we have added 'Bash GNU Shell' to his original hub.docker.com/r/trafex/php-nginx By adding about 6 Mb for Bash, you get convenience in development to code web applications that use advanced bash scripts—instead of Python, Perl, etc.—to implement PHP tasks even in production mode, 'only recommended for a localhost domain (127.0.0.1)'. My web applications are limited to localhost domains for security reasons and, due to sociological interests, because I like everyone to work with Bash GNU Shell. But this traffex/php-nginx fork in 'expert hands' should not present additional security risks on the Internet network.

We have added the 'Bash GNU Shell' at line 12 of the derivative Dockerfile. For security reasons, this change is not designed for running on Internet domains but only on the localhost domain (127.1.0.0.1). Any security weaknesses are due to the built-in native kernels (nginx, PHP, Bash, etc.), browser engine, and operating system security on the user side.

We have also changed the original 'Tim de Pater' web root folder 1. from /var/www/html to /var/www in the derivative, and its corresponding change in the nginx.conf file in the derivative, 2. access to any files in the web root folder in the nginx.conf file (line 42 of the derivative), and 3. the availability of 'txt' files by gzip_type on line 90 of the derivative.

Either way, you can always create your own derivative with Mr. Tim Pater's original at https://github.com/TrafeX/docker-php-nginx/archive/refs/heads/master.zip There you can modify your Dockerfile and the corresponding codes in 'nginx.conf' and other files.

You can run this derivative on localhost by placing the cursor on the command line in the folder whose files you want the server root '/var/www' to contain. Then you should execute the docker instruction in this way: sudo docker run --name=ArbitraryName -dp 80:8080 -v "$(pwd)":/var/www freeforfreedom:1.0 Access to the server files can be done in several ways, for example, http://localhost/none.php (default file that you can delete).
